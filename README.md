### How to build project

Make sure to have installed `(poetry)[https://python-poetry.org/docs/]` (python package manager) and `(python)[https://www.pythontutorial.net/getting-started/install-python/]` (language interpreter, 3.12 is better)

Now, be sure to create your virtual development environment for the Python project

```shell
> python3 -m venv install .venv && source ./.venv/bin/activate
```
